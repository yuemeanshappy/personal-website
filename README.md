## About me
Hi!
My name is Yue Yang (杨悦 in Chinese). I was raised up in Hangzhou, a beatiful coastal city combines modern technology (home to Alipay!) and natural scenary very well. I received my bachelor's degree in Agriculture at Zhejiang University where I majored in Horticulture (Yes, plants!) and found my interests lay in plants and nature. Meanwhile, I spent a half of year at UC Davis focusing on ecology and evolution in my third year as an exchange student. Currently, I am a master student in [Eaton Lab](https://eaton-lab.org) at [E3B department](http://e3b.columbia.edu), Columbia University. 

My research interests are quite broad. I am interested in plant biodiversity, especially morphological diversity and speciation process.

In my free time, I love hiking, painting, taking photos (not for myself, but plants/animals/nature/architecture) and food...
